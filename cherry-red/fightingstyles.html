            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1. While wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5. While wearing armor you are proficient with, your armor does not give you disadvantage on stealth checks.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 10. While wearing armor, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC instead of 1.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Fighting Style: Dueling</h2>
            <h3>1st Level Feat</h3>
            <p>You gain the following benefits based on your level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1. While wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5. While wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, and a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to increase your AC by your proficiency bonus for that attack only- possibly turning a hit into a miss. You can do this a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 10. While wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls you make instead of 2.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Fighting Style: Great Weapon Master</h2>
            <h3>1st Level Feat</h3>
            <p>You gain the following benefits based on your level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1. Whenever you roll your weapon’s damage dice and get a 1 or 2, you can choose to reroll those dice, but you must use the new roll.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5. Once per turn, whenever you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature’s hit points to 0 with one, you can make one additional attack as part of that same action.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 10. When you make a melee attack with a two-handed weapon or use a weapon’s versatile property, you can take a -3 penalty to the attack roll, but your weapon’s damage roll increases by +5 if the attack hits. If you land a critical hit when you take the penalty to the attack roll, your weapon’s damage roll increases by +10 instead of +5.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Fighting Style: Opportunist</h2>
            <h3>1st Level Feat</h3>
            <p>You gain the following benefits based on your level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1. Once per round, when you make an attack of opportunity, it doesn’t cost you your reaction.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5. Whenever a creature(s) in range of your melee weapon makes a Dexterity saving throw, you can make an attack of opportunity against one of them. If the creature succeeded the saving throw, you make the attack of opportunity against them at advantage as they dodge into your attack.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 10. You have advantage on attack rolls against another creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target creature and your ally isn't Incapacitated.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Fighting Style: Shield-Bearer</h2>
            <h3>1st Level Feat</h3>
            <p>You gain the following benefits based on your level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1. As a bonus action, if you are proficient in shields and are wielding one, you can make a melee attack against a creature within 5 ft. of you with your shield. This attack uses your Strength modifier and your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to the AC bonus the shield gives you + your Strength modifier and is forced back 5 ft. as long as they are no more than one size larger than you.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5. While wielding a shield, as a reaction to when a creature within 5 ft. of you is attacked or must make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your shield to aid them. Until the start of your next turn or until the creature is no longer within 5 ft. of you, that creature gains a bonus to their AC and Dexterity saving throws equal to the AC bonus the shield gives you.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 10. While wearing a shield, allies within 5 ft. gain a bonus to their AC equal to half the AC bonus that the shield gives you (rounded down). For example, wearing a shield that gives you +2 AC will give your allies +1 AC. This bonus to AC adds with the bonus you can give your allies at level 5.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting</h2>
            <h3>1st Level Feat</h3>
            <p>You gain the following benefits based on your level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1. When you take the attack action and attack with a melee weapon you’re holding in one hand, you can make an additional attack with a different melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand as part of your attack action. You can add your ability modifier to the damage of your second attack roll.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand and you can use two-weapon fighting with any melee weapon as long as it doesn’t have the two-handed property.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 10. If you gain the Extra Attack feature, you can make two attacks with your second weapon, instead of one, when you use your second weapon. Even if you gain additional attacks with your Extra Attack feature, you can only make up to two attacks with your second weapon as part of your bonus action.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Fighting Style: Unarmed Fighting</h2>
            <h3>1st Level Feat</h3>
            <p>You gain the following benefits based on your level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1. Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you aren’t wielding a shield or any weapons, the d6 becomes a d8 instead.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5. If you successfully dealt damage to a creature using your unarmed strike this turn, you can use your bonus action to attempt to grapple the creature (as long as the creature is no more than 1 size larger than you). Additionally, any creature Grappled by you takes bludgeoning damage equal to the damage of your unarmed strike at the start of their turns.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 10. A creature Grappled by you is also considered to be Restrained.</p></li>
            </ul>
