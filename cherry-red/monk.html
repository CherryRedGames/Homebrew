        </ul>
        <h2>1st Level: Martial Arts</h2>
        <p>Your practice in martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons (which are all simple weapons and martial weapons without the Heavy or Two-Handed property).</p>
        <p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons, provided that you’re not wearing any armor or wielding a shield:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <p>You become proficient with improvised weapons and can use your Martial Arts die for damage rolls you make with improvised weapons. Improvised weapons are considered to be monk weapons for you.</p></li>
            <li> <p>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</p></li>
            <li> <p>You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.</p></li>

        <p>You gain the Weapon Specialty: Monk Weapons feat and become proficient in all weapons in the Monk group if you aren’t already. All weapons in the Monk group are considered to be monk weapons for you.</p>
        <h2>2nd Level: Flurry of Blows</h2>
        <p>Once per round, you can use your bonus action to make two unarmed strikes. You can use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your Monk level. Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain expended uses of this feature equal to your Wisdom modififer (minimum 1).</p>

            <li> <p>Deflect Attack. You can use your reaction to deflect or catch a strike when you’re hit with an attack that would deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. When you do, roll your martial arts die- reduce the damage you would have taken by that amount. If you reduce the bludgeoning, slashing or piercing damage to 0, you can make one unarmed strike against the creature if it’s in range as part of the same reaction. If the attack was a ranged attack, and you reduced the damage to 0, you can throw the missile back if the missile is small enough to hold in one hand and you have at least one free hand. The attack made this way uses your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage roll, and its range becomes 60 ft.</p></li>
            <li> <p>Emboldened Initiative. Whenever you roll initiative, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the roll.</p></li>

        <h2>5th Level: Stunning Strike</h2>
        <p>Once per turn, when you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, you can attempt to give the creature the Stunned condition. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). On a failed saving throw, the creature is Stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is instead Dazed (can use their movement or action, not both and cannot take bonus actions or reactions) until the end of your next turn. You cannot use this feature on a creature that is already Stunned or Dazed from this feature.</p>
        <p>You can use this feature a number of times per short or long rest equal to your monk level.</p>

        <h1>Way of the Auric</h1>
        <p>Through your training, you’ve learned to harness aura- a form of life energy that radiates around and within the living. Those that can see the aura of others can discern their emotions based on the color of their aura.</p>
        <h2>3rd Level: Auric Vision</h2>
        <p>You can see the colors of the auras of living creatures within 30 ft. of you- even if they’re hidden or Invisible. The color of their aura varies based on their mood. You have advantage on Insight checks against a creature if you can see the color of their aura. As long as you can see a creature’s aura, they cannot gain any benefits from being Invisible to you. This feature does not work on constructs or the undead.</p>
        <h2>3rd Level: Mood Boost</h2>

        <h2>6th Level: Auric Blast</h2>
        <p>You learn how to manifest your aura to blast your foes. As an action, you can make two ranged spell attacks- each with a range of 60 ft.

        <h2>10th Level: Empowered Mood</h2>
        <p>The range of your Mood Boost feature doubles to 30 ft. and the benefits of your Mood Boost feature double.

        <h1>Way of the Blood Knuckle</h1>
        <p>These monks use the tactics that they’ve learned to brutalize their enemies. Unlike other monks, they do not align themselves to a monastery or other affiliation. Instead, many of these were monks in training that abandoned their mentors in order to pursue their personal goals.</p>
        <h2>3rd Level: Bleeding Strikes</h2>
        <p>A number of times per short or long rest equal to twice your proficiency bonus (minimum 1), whenever you land an attack using an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can choose to cause the creature you hit to bleed severely. When you do, roll your martials arts die once- that creature loses hit points equal to the number you roll. At the start of that creature’s turn, while they are bleeding this way, roll your martial arts die again- that creature loses hit points equal to the number you roll. A creature will bleed for up to 1 minute or until a creature uses an action to stop the bleeding or the creature recovers hit points from a magical source. You cannot use this feature on a creature that is already affected by this feature.</p>
        <p>Some creatures may be unaffected by this feature (such as animated armor, a ghost, a skeleton, or any other creature chosen by the DM).</p>

        <h2>6th Level: Hardened Body</h2>
        <p>Your body has become hardened from your constant brawling. Your hitpoint maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your monk level. Whenever you gain a monk level hereafter, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hit points. Additionally, you gain resistance to bludgeoning damage.</p>
        <h2>10th Level: Concussing Strike</h2>
        <p>Your strikes are so potent that you can concuss your enemies with a single blow. A number of times per short or long rest equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can have that creature make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes psychic damage equal to half your monk level (rounded down) and is under the effects of the Confusion spell for the next minute (they can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect early). On a successful saving throw, the creature only takes half of the psychic damage.</p>
        <h2>14th Level: Brutal Critical</h2>
        <p>Whenever you land a critical hit with an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can add half your monk level (rounded down) to the damage. This additional damage is the same type as your attack and is not doubled.</p>

        <h2>3rd Level: Desert Attunement</h2>
        <p>Your training within the desert has allowed you to attune to it. A number of times per short or long rest equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), you can cast a spell on the following table at its base level without expending a spell slot or material components. However, the spell’s base level must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. When you cast a spell using this feature, you use the spell’s casting time.

That creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed saving throw, the creature is considered to be Grappled. A Grappled creature can attempt to use their action to break out- repeating the saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature’s speed is halved. However, a creature Grappled by the quicksand that fails the saving throw sinks deeper into the quicksand and becomes Restrained. A creature entering the quicksand area on their turn or ending their turn within the pit must make the initial saving throw. You can use this feature a number of times per short or long rest equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>

        <ul>
            <li> <p>The Dust Mephits have 10 + your monk level in hit points.</p></li>
            <li> <p>If a Dust Mephit makes an attack with its claws, it uses the same bonus you get to making an unarmed attack.</p></li>
            <li> <p>The DC of any saving throw the Dust Mephit causes is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p></li>
            <li> <p>If you would be in range of the Dust Mephit's Death Burst or Blinding Breath effects, you automatically succeed the saving throw.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can only use this feature once per long rest. When you finish a long rest, any spirits that you summoned this way vanish.</p>

When you begin a short or long rest and still have unused numbers, the numbers disappear.</p>
        <h2>6th Level: Out-Boxer</h2>
        <p>Your practice allows you to hit your foes from a distance and keep away. Whenever you make a melee attack with a melee weapon in the monk group or make an unarmed strike, you can increase your attack’s reach by 5 ft.</p>
        <h2>6th Level: Shadow Decoy</h2>

As a bonus action OR as a reaction to when you are hit by an attack, you can choose to take half of the attack’s damage and teleport up to 30 ft. away to an unoccupied space that you can see- summoning a shadowboxer in the space you just left.</p>
        <p>The Shadowboxer resembles yourself, but is made out of shadow. The Shadowboxer has the same stats, monk features, AC, and movement speed as you. If your shadowboxer uses a monk feature, it uses one of your uses for it. Its hit points are equal to twice your Monk level. During your turn, the Shadowboxer can act and move as you wish. The Shadowboxer disappears at the end of your next turn or if its hit points are reduced to 0.</p>
        <h2>10th Level: Muscle Memory</h2>
        <p>Each time you land an attack roll against a creature, all attack rolls that you make against that creature are increased by 1 (up to your proficiency bonus) until the start of your next turn.</p>
