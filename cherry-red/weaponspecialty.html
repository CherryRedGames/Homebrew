        <h1>Weapon Specialty Feats</h1>
        <p>Whenever a Weapon Specialty feature mentions your weapon’s damage dice, it only refers to the dice that you roll for that weapon (as listed on the weapons table and with weapon scaling). For example, the weapon damage dice of a Flametongue Dagger that deals 1d4 piercing + 2d6 fire would refer only to the 1d4 (if the wielder was at least level 5, this would become 2d4 because of weapon scaling).</p>
