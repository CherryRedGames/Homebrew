            <h1>Circle of Visions</h1>
            <p>These druids undergo a spiritual journey aided by the use of psychedelics to better understand themselves and the universe around them. Their magic creates visions for themselves and others.</p>
            <p>Imagine that your mind is a snowy hill and that thoughts are sleds going down the hill. After a while, the sleds form grooves. Eventually, when a thought goes down that hill, it can’t help but be caught in one of the grooves. This is your ego. What an ego death does is flatten the snow, like a fresh layer. This means that the sleds can go down different paths. In an ego death, your realizations change you so much that your old ego is considered to be dead. You begin to question your reality more and more, perceiving the illusory nature of life. Then, you realize that you’re imagining everything. You and everyone else is part of the infinite consciousness (or god) that has split itself into infinite perspectives (egos) to perceive, explore, experience, and love itself infinitely. We are alone in the cosmos, but in the illusion of life and through our many egos, we are together. The past is made up, the future doesn’t exist, the only thing that exists is the present. In an ego death, you get a glimpse into the infinite.</p>
            <h2>2nd Level: Circle Spells</h2>
            <p>You always have certain spells ready. When you reach a druid level specified in the table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. These spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare, and they follow the rules of this class’s Spellcasting feature. You also learn the Minor Illusion cantrip.</p>

            <h2>2nd Level: Enchanting Visions</h2>
            <p>Whenever a creature fails a saving throw from one of your Enchantment spells, you can cast Minor Illusion on the creature without expending an action or using any somatic or material components. The duration of the illusion lasts until the Enchantment spell affecting the creature ends.</p>
            <h2>6th Level: Spiritual Visions</h2>
            <p>Whenever you cast an Illusion spell, you gain temporary hit points equal to the spell slot level used multiplied by your spellcasting modifier (minimum 1). These temporary hit points last up to 1 minute.</p>
            <h2>10th Level: Heightened Delusions</h2>
            <p>When a creature fails a saving throw from one of your Enchantment spells, the creature falls under the effects of the Hallucinatory Terrain spell and perceives all terrain as a hallucination of your choice that they believe is real until the Enchantment spell affecting the creature ends.</p>
            <h2>10th Level: Spiritual Insight</h2>
            <p>Your experiences with hallucinogens have granted you spiritual insights. You learn the Borrowed Knowledge and Contact Other Plane spells- which you can cast as an action. Additionally, you can cast Contact Other Plane on another creature that you can see within 30 ft. of you. When you do, you force them to make the Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, they suffer the negative effects of the spell. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes 3d6 psychic damage and can instantly ask up to five questions- taking psychic damage equal to your spellcasting modifier for each question they ask. You know the questions they ask and the answers they receive.</p>
            <h2>14th Level: Ego Death</h2>
            <p>Your spiritual journey with psychedelics has given you a life-changing experience: an ego death. You experience grants you the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>You become resistant to psychic damage.</p></li>
                <li> <p>You become proficient in one skill of your choice and gain expertise in one skill you are proficient in.</p></li>
                <li> <p>You gain 1 Legendary Resistance per day where, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Circle of Witchcraft</h1>
            <p>Witches are those who practice witchcraft- where one utilizes the natural magics around them through refining personalized rituals that synergize with an individual and their intentions. </p>
            <h2>2nd Level: Circle Spells</h2>
            <p>Your unique practice ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a druid level specified in the following table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. These spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare, and are considered to be druid spells for you. Whenever “???” appears in the table, you can choose one spell from the arcane spell list to replace “???”. The spell you choose must be of a level that you can cast.</p>

            <h2>2nd Level: Evil Eye</h2>
            <p>You can give someone a look of malicious intent, causing harm and misfortune with a gaze. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see: that creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful saving throw, nothing happens. On a failed saving throw, the creature suffers the effects of one of the following spells: Bane, Inflict Wounds, Hex. The spell’s effects are considered to be at their base level. If the spell is Bane or Hex, the spell lasts 1 minute and is not considered concentration for this feature. A creature can only be affected by one of this feature’s effects at a time. You can use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</p>
            <h2>6th Level: Book of Shadows</h2>
            <p>You have a book containing arcane secrets either passed down through generations or accumulated through research. You gain a number of eldritch invocations of your choice equal to your proficiency bonus, as long as you meet the prerequisites for the invocation. For you, a warlock level prerequisite applies to your druid level and a Pact of the Chain prerequisite instead requires you to know the Find Familiar spell. An invocation specifying a warlock level or warlock pact slot uses your druid level or druid spell slot instead.</p>
            <h2>6th Level: Herbalist's Brew</h2>
            <p>As part of a long rest, you can make potions, as long as you have a container to make it in. You can make 1 common potion during your long rest, which requires you to expend a 2nd level spell slot while crafting the potion. Alternatively, you can make 1 uncommon potion during your long rest, which requires you to expend a 3rd level spell slot while crafting the potion. You also learn the Tasha’s Caustic Brew spell. It does not count against the number of spells you have prepared.</p>
            <h2>10th Level: Empowered Eye</h2>
            <p>Whenever you use your Evil Eye feature, you can expend a spell slot to have the target fall under the effects of the Bestow Curse spell (at its base level). This effect is not considered to be concentration for you.</p>
            <h2>10th Level: Psychic Reading</h2>
            <p>As part of a short or long rest, you can give another creature, or yourself, a reading. A reading requires you to spend time meditating with the creature. At the end of the reading, roll 2d20 and have the creature record the numbers. The creature can replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that they make or any attack roll made against them with one of the recorded numbers. They can choose to do so after the roll, but before the outcome is determined. Each number can only be used once and, when the creature starts another rest, they lose any unused numbers. You can use this feature once per rest.</p>
            <h2>14th Level: Devouring Hexes</h2>
            <p>You learn the Enervation spell and can cast it as a reaction when you’re hit by a melee attack. You also learn the Eyebite spell. These spelle are considered to be druid spells for you and don’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare.</p>
