            <p>Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields</p>
            <p>Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons</p>
            <p>Tools: None</p>
            <p>Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity</p>
            <p>Skills: Choose 3 from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth Survival</p>
            <h1>Equipment</h1>
            <p>You start with the following equipment in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor</p></li>
                <li> <p>(a) a shortsword or (b) a longbow and 20 arrows</p></li>
                <li> <p>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1st Level: Hunter's Mark</h2>
            <p>You can focus your senses on a creature, mystically marking them. If you study a creature’s tracks for 1 minute or see the creature within 90 ft. of you, you can magically mark them as a bonus action. The target is marked as long as they are on the same plane of existence as you and isn’t protected from divination magic. The mark also vanishes if you finish a short or long rest, are rendered Incapacitated, or use this feature again to target another creature. While a creature is marked, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>You have advantage on any Investigation, Perception, or Survival checks you make to find the target and have advantage on all Insight checks made on the marked creature.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Your weapon and spell damage rolls deal additional damage equal to your Hunter’s Mark die, as shown on the Hunter’s Mark Die column of the ranger’s table. When you land a critical hit, this damage is also doubled. This additional damage is the same type of damage as your weapon or spell.</p></li>
                <li> <p>As long as the creature is marked, it cannot become Invisible. If the creature was Invisible when you marked them, the effect making the creature Invisible ends.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1st Level: Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>Spell Preperation. You have the following spells prepared: Ensnaring Strike, Goodberry, Guidance, and Thorn Whip. Alternatively, you can prepare two 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. Any spell you prepare for this class must be a Primal spell, and it can be from any school of magic except from Evocation.</p>
            <p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace any spell you have prepared for this class with another Primal spell of the same level that isn’t Evocation.</p>
            <p>At higher levels in this class, you can prepare more spells, as shown on the ranger table. The numbers there determine the number of different spells you can prepare of each level. For example, as a 3rd-level ranger, you can prepare two different 0-level spells and three different 1st-level spells.</p>
            <p>Spell Slots. The ranger table shows how many spell slots you have at each level to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher; the number of different spells you can prepare of each level equals the number of spell slots you have at that level. For example, as a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1st-level slots and two 2nd-level spell slots.</p>
            <p>Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells.</p>
            <h2>2nd Level: Expertise</h2>

            <h1>Trapper</h1>
            <p>These rangers use their connection with nature to trap both prey and foe alike.</p>
            <h2>3rd Level: Nature's trap</h2>
            <p>When you take the attack action, you can choose to forgo any number of your attacks to imbue the ground around you to trap your foes. For each attack you forgo, you can create one type of trap of your choice. You can only have a number of traps summoned equal to your proficiency bonus. If you exceed this number, the oldest trap disappears. A trap remains until a minute passess or if you become Incapacitated. You choose one of the following options for your traps when you use this feature. Whenever a creature within 30 ft. of you uses their movement and is in contact with the ground, you can use your reaction to trigger one of your traps.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Bear Trap. When the trap activates, the creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes piercing damage equal to a roll of your Hunter’s Mark die and their movement speed becomes 0 as long as they remain trapped. A creature can use their action to make an Athletics check against your spell save DC to escape the trap. On a successful saving throw, they take half the damage, but are not trapped.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Pitfall Trap. When the trap activates, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the ground opens up beneath them and they fall down 10 ft. x your Wisdom modifier. If a creature succeeds the initial saving throw or climbs out, the hole closes as if it were never there. Anything in the hole when it closes, is harmlessly moved to the nearest, empty space.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Tripwire. When the trap activates, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the creature falls Prone and has their movement halved until the start of your next turn.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once a creature fails or succeeds the initial saving throw of your trap, that specific trap cannot be used again until the start of your next turn. This means that the same trap could trap multiple creatures at the same time, just on different turns.</p>
            <h2>3rd Level: Trapper's Magic</h2>
            <p>You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the following table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p>
            <table class="subclass_table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Ranger Level</th>

                    <td>Steel Wind Strike</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h2>6th Level: Trapper's Reflexes</h2>
            <p>Once per round, when you trigger a trap from your Nature’s Trap feature, it does not use your reaction. This becomes twice per round at level 10 and three times per round at level 14.</p>
            <h2>10th Level: Empowered Traps</h2>
            <p>Your traps now gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Bear Trap. The piercing damage of this spell becomes two rolls of your Hunter’s Mark die instead of one.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Pitfall Trap. Natural spikes now form at the bottom of the pit. A creature who falls into the pit takes piercing damage equal to a roll of your Hunter’s Mark die.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Tripwire. The tripwire deals slashing damage equal to your Hunter’s Mark die- regardless of if the creature fails or succeeds the saving throw.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>14th Level: Land Mine</h2>
            <p>You learn the Erupting Earth spell, which doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. Additionally, as a reaction to when a creature within 30 ft. of you uses their movement, you can destroy one of your traps from your Nature’s Trap feature to cast Erupting Earth, centered on that creature.</p>
