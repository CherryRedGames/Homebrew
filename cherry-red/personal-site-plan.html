      <h3>Artificer</h3>
      <p>
        [Glassblower
        These artificers work with glass. Many of these artificers focus on creating eyewear or other products. 
        
        3RD LEVEL: EYEWEAR
        You can spend 1 hour and 15sp worth of materials to create eyewear for a specific creature. A creature wearing this eyewear gains a bonus to Investigation and Perception checks that rely on sight equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). A creature can only benefit from wearing one piece of eyewear at a time. 
                
        3RD LEVEL: GLASSBLOWER SPELLS
        You always have certain spells prepared when you reach specific levels in artificer, as shown in the table below. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells that you prepare. 
        You can cast Heat Metal on glass as well as metal and you can cast the spell as a bonus action. When you cast this spell on a weapon from your Glass Weaponry feature, the weapons deal additional fire damage equal to the fire damage dealt by the spell, but you do not take any fire damage from holding the weapon.

        3RD LEVEL: TOOL PROFICIENCY
        At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with glassblower’s tools. If you are already proficient with glassblower’s tools, you can choose one other type of artisan’s tools to become proficient in. Additionally, you can turn sand into glass with your glassblower’s tools.

        6TH LEVEL: EXTRA ATTACK
        You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the attack action.

        6TH LEVEL: GLASS WEAPONRY
        You learn how to create weapons made of glass. As an action, you can expend a spell slot to create one simple melee weapon that deals slashing damage. You can make a weapon this way as long as you have at least one hand free. The glass weapon will appear in your hand. The weapon you create is considered magical and deals additional slashing damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Whenever you land a weapon attack roll with a glass weapon that you made with this feature, you can immediately use a bonus action to cause the weapon to shatter. The weapon instantly breaks and the creature you attacked takes an additional 3d6 slashing damage. The glass weapon can last for up to 1 minute or until it is shattered.

        10TH LEVEL: ARMOR OF GLASS
        You learn the Armor of Agathys spell. However, instead of frost, shrapnel glass coats the outside of your armor and gear. A creature that hits you with a melee attack takes slashing damage from the spell instead of cold.

        14TH LEVEL: GLASS STORM
        You're now able to conjure a storm of burning shards of glass. Once per long rest, you can cast Incendiary Cloud at 8th level without using a spell slot. When you cast the spell using this feature, a creature that fails the Dexterity saving throw is also Blinded for the next minute. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the Blinded condition early.

        Pyrotechnician
        A pyrotechnician focuses on the chemical processes behind fireworks, gunpowder, and other processes.

        3RD LEVEL: HAND MORTAR
        You create a hand mortar: a portable firearm with a short barrel to launch special fireworks that you make.
        Each firework that you make for this feature costs 10sp of materials and takes 15 minutes to produce. As an action, you can launch the firework and make it explode a maximum distance of 120 ft. away. All creatures in a 30 ft. radius of the explosion must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, creatures take Xd6 fire damage (where X is your Intelligence modifier, minimum 1). On a successful saving throw, they take half the fire damage. 
        You can apply additional effects to your firework by spending more money in its construction:
        Radiant. All creatures in a 30 ft. radius of the firework must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw,  the creatures suffer Xd4 radiant damage (where X is your Intelligence modifier, minimum 1) and are Blinded until the end of their next turn. On a successful saving throw, they only take half of the radiant damage. You must spend an additional 10sp when constructing your firework to give it this effect.
        Thundering. All creatures in a 30 ft. radius of the firework must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the creatures suffer Xd4 thunder damage (where X is your Intelligence modifier, minimum 1) and are Deafened until the end of their next turn. On a successful saving throw, they only take half of the thunder damage. You must spend an additional 5sp when constructing your firework to give it this effect.

        3RD LEVEL: PYROTECHNICIAN SPELLS
        You always have certain spells prepared when you reach specific levels in artificer, as shown in the table below. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells that you prepare. 

        3RD LEVEL: TOOL PROFICIENCY
        You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies. If you are already proficient with alchemist’s supplies, you can choose one other type of artisan’s tools to become proficient in.

        6TH LEVEL: FLAMING MISSILES
        You learn the Magic Missile spell if you don’t know it already. It doesn’t count against the number of artificer spells you have prepared. Whenever you cast the spell, each dart deals additional fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Once per long rest, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot.  

        10TH LEVEL: SHOWMAN’S FINESSE
        Whenever an ally would have to make a saving throw because of ammunition made from your Explosive Weaponry feature, or one of your Pyrotechnician spells, they can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) to their saving throw.

        14TH LEVEL: GRAND FINALE
        Once per long rest, you can choose to double the damage a firework from your Hand Mortar feature deals.

      <h3>Cleric</h3>
      <p>
        [Oracle Domain
        Oracles do not choose their path, it is chosen for them- usually from a source unknown to the oracle. While great boons are granted, this often comes at the cost of the oracle being bombarded with information. 
        
        2ND LEVEL: DOMAIN SPELLS
        Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a cleric level specified in the table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. These spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare, and they follow the rules of this class’s Spellcasting feature. 
        2ND LEVEL: ORACLE’S CURSE
Torrential knowledge floods your mind at all times. If you are immune or resistant to psychic damage, you are no longer immune or resistant to psychic damage and can never become immune or resistant to psychic damage. Additionally, you become proficient in the Religion skill if you aren’t already and one other skill that uses your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier. 


2ND LEVEL: ORACLE’S GIFT
When you or a creature within 60 ft. of you that you can see makes an attack roll or ability check, you can use your reaction to roll 1d8 and add or subtract the number rolled to the roll. You can choose to do this after the roll, but before the outcome is determined. When you do, you take psychic damage equal to the number rolled. You can use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus. 


6TH LEVEL: CURSE OF TORRENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to bombard a creature you can see within 60 ft. of you. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the creature is Dazed (can use their movement or action, not both and cannot take bonus actions or reactions) until the end of your next turn. On a successful saving throw, you take psychic damage equal to half your cleric level (rounded down).


6TH LEVEL: EMPOWERED GIFT
You can now use your Oracle’s Gift feature when a creature makes a saving throw. However, the psychic damage you take is doubled when you use it for a creature’s saving throw.


10TH LEVEL: BENEVOLENT GUIDE
Whenever you cast one of your domain spells, you and one other creature within 30 ft. of you of your choice gain temporary hit points equal to half your cleric level (rounded down). These hit points last up to 1 minute.


10TH LEVEL: EMPOWERED DIVINATION
When you finish a long rest, you can choose one divination spell from any school of magic to have prepared until you begin another long rest. It is considered to be a domain spell for you. However, you take psychic damage equal to the spell’s level when you prepare it and when you cast it.


14TH LEVEL: THIRD EYE
Once per short or long rest, as an action, you can enter a trance-like state where you can gaze into the immediate future. For the next minute, you fall under the effects of the Foresight spell. However, when you use this feature, you take psychic damage equal to your cleric level.
Soul Shepherd Domain
Not all souls pass on properly. Many spirits linger in the form of ghosts, chained to the mortal realm by unfulfilled wishes. Soul shepherds are responsible for guiding these souls into the afterlife- even channeling these spirits to aid them. Many of these clerics worship gods of death.


2ND LEVEL: DOMAIN SPELLS
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a cleric level specified in the table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. These spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare, and they follow the rules of this class’s Spellcasting feature. 
2ND LEVEL: SHEPHERD’S TOOL
You create a tool to carry the souls you come across. As a reaction, when a humanoid creature within 30 ft. of you dies, or when a spirit or similar undead creature is reduced to 0 hit points, you can absorb their soul into your shepherd’s tool. The total number of souls that your tool can hold at one time is equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Alternatively, a willing ghost or other similar creature can spend their action to enter your shepherd’s tool. You share a telepathic bond with the souls within your tool.
	You can use the spirits within your tool to cast spells listed on the following table at their base level. You do not need to have a spell on the table prepared to cast a spell for this feature. The spell’s casting time is a bonus action for you. Whenever you cast a spell with this feature, you do not use up a spell slot, nor do you need material components. Once a soul within your tool is used to cast a spell with this feature, it cannot be used again until you finish a long rest.
  6TH LEVEL: COMMUNING WITH THE WAYWARD
  As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to commune with nearby spirits. For the next hour, you can see, hear, and speak with nearby spirits and can see 60 ft. into the Ethereal Plane. You also gain temporary hit points equal to your cleric level. These temporary hit points last up to 1 hour.
  
  
  10TH LEVEL: BANISHER OF SOULS
  You are better able to force spirits to the afterlife. You can cast Banishment at its base level as a bonus action instead of an action if the creature that you banish is undead. Undead creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw of the spell. Additionally, you can expend a use of one of your souls from your shepherd’s tool to target one additional creature whenever you cast Banishment.
  
  
  14TH LEVEL: STEPPING BEYOND
  Once per long rest, you can cast Soul Cage or Etherealness at their base level without using a spell slot.
