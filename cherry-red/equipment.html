            <h2>Unconventional Weapons</h2>
            <p>These weapons are rarely used on the battlefield. However, in the right hands, they can be highly effective. You won't find them in any armory, but you might find them as old heirlooms or as items sold in a trinket shop. To be proficient with these weapons, you must have the Weapon Specialty feat for their weapon group.</p>
            <h2>Range</h2>
            <p>A weapon’s range dictates how far away you can be from your target when making an attack. To make a ranged attack without disadvantage, you must be at least 10 ft. away from the target (and any other hostile creatures), while remaining within the listed range.</p>
            <p>Making a ranged attack against a creature while within 5 ft. of the target, within 5 ft. of a hostile creature, or beyond the weapon’s listed range is at disadvantage. The maximum range that you can attempt to hit a creature from with a ranged attack is equal to twice the listed range (this is considered to be long range for feats such as the Weapon Specialty: Bow Weapons feat).</p>
            <p>For example, because the Thrown range of a dagger is 20 ft., attacking a target that is 20 ft. away is rolled as normal. If a creature tried throwing a dagger beyond that range (up to 40 ft.), the attack roll would be at disadvantage.</p>
            <h2>Special Property</h2>
            <p>You must be proficient in a weapon to use its Special property.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Arm Blades. A pair of blades that are tied to your forearm to slash at foes. If you wear one arm blade on each of your arms, your AC is increased by a total of 1. While wearing these weapons, you cannot wield a shield, use any weapons with the two-handed property, or use the versatile property of a weapon.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Boomerang. When you take the attack action with this weapon, you can also choose to expend your bonus action. When you do, you make two attack rolls instead of one per attack- but both rolls must be against the same creature. The first attack is the boomerang going away from you and the second one is as it returns to you. However, you do not add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll on the second (returning) attack. Immediately after the second attack, it returns to your hand- allowing you to use it again if you can. So, if you have the Extra Attack feature, you make four attacks instead of two as your Attack action</p></li>
                <li> <p>Brass Knuckles. Whenever you make an unarmed attack and hit a foe, you can choose to add this weapon's damage dice to your damage roll.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Kusarigama. Once per turn, when you hit a Large or smaller creature with this weapon, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed saving throw, the creature is pulled to an unoccupied space adjacent to you.</p> </li>
                <li> <p>Lacerating Ribbon. Instead of using your Strength or Dexterity modifier for this weapon's attack and damage rolls, you can choose to use your Charisma modifier instead.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Serrated Handfan. A durable, ornate handfan with bladed edges. As a bonus action, you can attempt to use the fan to create a gust of wind against a Medium-sized or smaller creature within 10 ft. of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (minimum 1)). On a failed saving throw, the creature is forced 10 ft. back and knocked Prone. On a successful saving throw, they're only forced 5 ft. back.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Yo-Yo. Once per turn, when you hit a Large or smaller creature with this weapon, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed saving throw, the creature is pulled to an unoccupied space adjacent to you.</p></li>

            <h2>Acid (vial)</h2>
            <p>You can splash the contents on a creature within 5 ft. of you or throw the vial up to 20 ft. and cause it to shatter. Either way, make a ranged attack against the creature, treating the vial as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the creature takes 2d4 acid damage. The acid continues to burn the creature for 1d4+1 turns.</p>
            <h2>Alchemist's Fire</h2>
            <p>You can splash the contents on a creature within 5 ft. of you or throw the flask up to 20 ft. and cause it to shatter. Either way, make a ranged attack against the creature, treating the flask as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the creature suffers 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns for 1d4 turns or until a creature uses an action to snuff out the flames.</p>
            <h2>Antitoxin</h2>
            <p>A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p>
            <h2>Poison (basic)</h2>
            <p> It takes an action to apply to a weapon or 5 pieces of ammunition. A creature hit with a melee weapon or piece of ammunition coated in this poison must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d6 poison dmg on a failed saving throw. Once applied on a weapon or ammunition, poison retains potency for 1 minute.</p>
            <h2>Potion of Growth</h2>
            <p>After drinking the potion, the creature’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight for the next 1d4 hours. This growth increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. While enlarged this way, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attack with them deals 1d4 extra damage.</p>
            <h2>Potion of Healing (Common)</h2>
            <p>A creature that drinks this potion heals 2d4+2 hit points.</p>
            <h2>Greater Potion of Healing (Uncommon)</h2>
            <p>A creature that drinks this potion heals 4d4+4 hit points.</p>
            <h2>Superior Potion of Healing (Rare)</h2>
            <p>A creature that drinks this potion heals 8d4+8 hit points.</p>
            <h2>Potion of Love</h2>
            <p>The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become Charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.</p>
            <h2>Potion of Luck</h2>
            <p>After drinking this potion, you gain 2 luck points- which last up to 1 hour. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20 and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.</p>
            <h2>Potion of Polymorph (Uncommon-Very Rare)</h2>
            <p>After drinking the potion, the creature falls under the Polymorph spell for an hour. The highest CR of the creature they can transform into is 2 for uncommon, 3 for rare, and 4 for very rare. The cost starts at 30sp for an uncommon potion and increases by 15sp for each rarity.</p>
            <h2>Potion of Purification</h2>
            <p>After drinking the potion, the creature falls under the Lesser Restoration spell.</p>
            <h2>Potion of Shrinking</h2>
            <p>After drinking the potion, the creature’s size halves in all dimensions, and its weight is divided by eight for the next 1d4 hours. This growth decreases its size by one category - from Large to Medium, for example. While shrunk this way, the target also has advantage on Stealth checks and Dexterity saving throws. The creature’s AC also increases by 2.</p>
