            <p>Once per long rest, if you or a creature that you can see within 30 ft. of you roll a d20 for an attack roll or ability check, you can use your reaction to change the number that was rolled to a natural 1 or a natural 20. You can do this after they roll, but must do it before the outcome is determined.</p>
