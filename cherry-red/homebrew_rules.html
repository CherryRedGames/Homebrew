                    <h1>Combat Rules</h1>
                    <h2>Critical Hits with a Weapon</h2>
                    <p>When you land a critical hit with a weapon, you can choose to do one of the following BEFORE you roll damage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <p>Roll your dice as normal, but double the result. For example, attacking with a weapon that has a d6 damage die, you would roll 1d6 and double the number you roll.</p></li>
                        <li> <p>Roll twice as many dice. For example, attacking with a weapon that has a d6 damage die, you would roll 2d6.</p></li>
                        <li> <p>Roll as you normally would, and then add the maximum you can roll to the total. For example, attacking with a weapon that has a d6 damage die, you would roll a d6 as you normally would and add the maximum you can roll (6) to the total.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Drawing & Sheathing Weapons</h2>
                    <p>For the purposes of streamlining combat, you can change the weapon(s) you’re holding for a different weapon without using a bonus action or action once per turn. </p>
                    <h2>Holding the Attack Action</h2>
                    <p>If you hold your action to attack a creature, you make all attacks you can as though you’re using your attack action (such as Extra Attack), etc. This does NOT apply to bonus action attacks like the Two-Weapon Fighting feat.</p>
                    <h2>Flanking</h2>
                    <p>When flanking an enemy with an ally that is not Incapacitated, you gain a +2 to attack rolls.</p>
                    <h2>Potions</h2>
                    <p>You can drink a potion as a bonus action. However, if you drink a potion of healing as an action, you don’t roll for healing and instead recover the highest amount total. It is an action to pour a potion down someone else’s throat.</p>
                    <h2>Weapon Scaling</h2>
                    <p>Over time, you become more skilled with your weapon. If you are proficient in a weapon, you can roll an additional damage die at level 5. This rule also applies to unarmed strikes (like the Monk class or Tabaxi race feature). </p>
                    <p>For example, if you are proficient with simple melee weapons and attack with a handaxe at level 5, you roll 2d6 instead of 1d6. If you land a critical hit, these additional damage dice are doubled as well, so you’d roll 4d6. OR if you are proficient with a musket at level 5, you roll 3d12 instead of 2d12. If you land a critical hit, it becomes 6d12.</p>

                    <h1>Miscellaneous Rules</h1>
                    <h2>Exhaustion</h2>
                    <p>For each level of exhaustion a character has (up to 10), that creature’s attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws are reduced by their level of exhaustion. A creature that reaches 10 levels of exhaustion dies.</p>
                    <h2>Long Rest</h2>
                    <p>Long rests work as normal, except you only restore half of your maximum hit points.</p>

                    <h1>New Monetary System</h1>
                    <p>References to the cost of materials, equipment, or other things located on other pages use an altered monetary system where silver (sp) is used more predominantly thangold (gp). In this system, rewards are typically given out in silver (sp). For a quick conversion between typical 5e prices and this version, change all mentions of sp on these pages to gp in your own games. Below is a table for conversions:</p>
