            <p>Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier</p>
            <p>Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st</p>
            <h1>Proficiencies</h1>
            <p>Armor: Light armor</p>
            <p>Weapons: Simple weapons</p>

            <p>Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma</p>
            <p>Skills: Choose 2 from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, Religion</p>
            <h1>Equipment</h1>
            <p>You start with the following equipment in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>(a) a hand crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</p></li>
                <li> <p>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</p></li>
                <li> <p>(a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack</p></li>
                <li> <p>Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1st Level: Pact Boon</h2>
            <p>Choose one of the following boons. Each boon gives you a choice for your spellcasting ability for your Spellcasting feature and an additional feature.</p>
            <p>Pact of the Blade</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Spellcasting Ability: Wisdom or Charisma</p></li>
                <li> <p>Pact Weapon. As a bonus action, you can magically conjure a melee weapon in your empty hand, but it must lack the Two-Handed property. You are proficient with it while you wield it. When you make an attack with a weapon conjured this way, you can choose to use your spellcasting ability for the weapon’s attack and damage rolls instead of Strength or Dexterity. If the weapon has the Thrown property, it returns to your hand after hitting or missing the target. When you reach 5th level as a Warlock, you gain the Extra Attack feature for your conjured weapon only.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pact of the Chain</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence or Charisma</p></li>
                <li> <p>Pact Familiar. You learn the Find Familiar spell. It does not count against the number of spells you know and, once per long rest, you can cast it as an action without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell, you can also choose for it to take one of the following forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, skeleton, or sprite. Alternatively, you can choose to have your familiar be any creature with a CR less than or equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). Whenever you conjure your familiar, it gains temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour. A familiar summoned this way takes its turn immediately after you and can act on its turn as you wish. A familiar uses your proficiency bonus and, if your familiar attacks, you can choose to have it use your spellcasting modifier instead of its normal attack modifier for the attack roll. If your familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can have it use your spell save DC. Additionally, whenever your familiar would take damage, you can use your reaction to give your familiar resistance to the damage.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pact of the Tome</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence or Wisdom</p></li>
                <li> <p>Book of Shadows. Through the guidance of your patron, you’ve created a book containing magical knowledge. Choose three 1st-level spells from the arcane or primal spell list: those spells are considered warlock spells for you and do not count against the number of spells you know. If the book is lost or destroyed, you can perform a 1 hour ritual to recreate it. Whenever you take a long rest, you can change one of your chosen spells for another spell that is a level equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) or lower.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1st Level: Spellcasting</h2>
            <p>Spell Preperation. You have the following spells prepared: Eldritch Blast, Hex, Prestidigitation, and Witch Bolt. Alternatively, you can prepare two cantrips and two 1st-level spells of your choice. Any spell you prepare for this class must be an Arcane spell. Whenever you gain a level in warlock, you can replace any spell you have prepared for this class with another Arcane spell of the same level. At higher levels in this class, you can prepare more spells, as shown on the warlock table. The numbers there determine the number of different spells you can prepare of each level.</p>
            <p>Pact Slots. The warlock table shows how many pact slots you have at each level to cast your warlock spells of 1st level and higher; the number of different spells you can prepare of each level equals the number of pact slots you have at that level. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you recover all of your pact slots.</p>
            <p>Spellcasting Ability. Your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells is determined by your Pact Boon feature.</p>
            <h2>2nd Level: Eldritch Invocations</h2>
            <p>You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. You can’t pick the same invocation more than once, unless it says otherwise. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet that prerequisite to pick it. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown on the warlock table. Additionally, whenever you gain a warlock level, you can replace one of your eldritch invocations with another one of your choice.</p>
            <h2>3rd Level: Dark Petition</h2>
            <p>You can reach out to your patron and mutter a quick plea for aid. Once per short or long rest, as a bonus action, you recover a number of expended pact slots equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down).</p>
            <p>However, a patron may see this plea as being greedy or ungrateful for the boons already given. At the DM’s discretion, a patron might inflict a minor punishment in exchange for this favor. Some examples might be taking 1d4 necrotic damage for each level of the restored pact slots, inflicting the Poisoned or Slowed condition for 1 round, giving 1 level of exhaustion, or any other minor penalty.</p>
            <h2>3rd Level: Warlock Subclass</h2>
            <p>You gain one warlock subclass of your choice. You gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your warlock level and lower. This class’s description tells you the levels when your subclass provides features.</p>
            <h2>4th Level: Feat</h2>
            <p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p>
            <h2>6th Level: Subclass Feature</h2>
            <p>You gain a feature from your warlock subclass.</p>
            <h2>8th Level: Feat</h2>
            <p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p>
            <h2>9th Level: Contact Patron</h2>
            <p>You always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. Once per long rest, you can cast the spell without expending a pact slot or any material components. When you cast the spell this way, you automatically succeed the saving throw.</p>
            <h2>10th Level: Subclass Feature</h2>
            <p>You gain a feature from your warlock subclass.</p>
            <h2>11th Level: Mystic Arcanum</h2>
            <p>Choose one 6th-level spell from the arcane spell list: you can cast it once per long rest without expending a spell slot. At higher levels, you can cast additional spells this way: one 7th-level spell at level 13, one 8th-level spell at level 15, and one 9th-level spell at level 17. You can cast all of these spells once per long rest without expending a spell slot. A spell cast with this feature is considered to be a warlock spell for you.</p>
            <h2>12th Level: Feat</h2>
            <p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p>
            <h2>14th Level: Subclass Feature</h2>

            <h2>16th Level: Feat</h2>
            <p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p>
            <h2>18th Level: Patron's Influence</h2>
            <p>Your dealings with your patron have changed you- permanently marking you as theirs. You gain one of the following features of your choice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Arcane Prowess. Your spellcasting ability score from your Pact Boon feature increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Additionally, whenever one of your warlock spells would deal damage, you can add your spellcasting ability score from your Pact Boon feature to the damage roll.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Broadened Mind. You can concentrate on up to two spells at a time (you cannot concentrate on two of the same spell at a time) and have advantage on concentration checks to maintain them.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Gifted Sight. You become proficient in Insight and Perception checks if you’re not already proficient in them. If you’re already proficient in either of them, you gain expertise in them. Additionally, you gain 30 ft. of Truesight.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depending on the feature you choose, the DM might alter your appearance slightly. For example, if you chose the Gifted Sight feature, the DM might change the color of your eyes, give you a third eye, or alter your appearance in another way.</p>
            <h2>19th Level: Feat</h2>
            <p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p>
            <h2>20th Level: Eldritch Master</h2>
            <p>Your faithfulness to your patron has granted you the favor of your patron. When you use your Dark Petition feature, you recover all expended pact slots and you incur no penalties from your patron. However, you can only use your Dark Petition feature once per long rest.</p>

Choose 1 Large or smaller creature that you can see within 30 ft. of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the creature is Grappled and Restrained by the chains.
