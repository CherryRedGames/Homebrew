        <h1>Forge Warrior</h1>
        <p>These warriors have a history with the forge. Some have worked at smithing guilds while others try to create their own weapons to hone their craft. These fighters have a passion for their gear, valuing them higher than most other possessions. Many choose to fight with the tools they’ve made as a way to show off their work to others or find a place to work. No matter the fighter, the forge holds a place in their heart.</p>
        <h2>3rd Level: Favorite Weapon</h2>
        <p>Your love for specific weapons grants you insights that boost your fighting abilities. Choose one type of simple melee weapon or one type of martial melee weapon: you can add your proficiency bonus to any damage rolls you make using that weapon.</p>
        <h2>3rd Level: Forge Warrior</h2>
        <p>Your work in the forge has honed your capabilities. As such, you become proficient in Smith’s Tools. Additionally, you learn the Mending cantrip.</p>
        <h2>6th Level: Trade Secrets</h2>
        <p>You know how to create certain types of armor and weaponry. To make these items, you need to gather resources that have a cost equal to half of the item’s normal cost and you need access to a forge or similar place to work. To you, a workday is 8 hours.</p>
        <p>The items you can make must be made with a significant amount of metal. For example, even though a 10th level fighter can make medium armor, they cannot make Hide Armor as it is primarily made of furs. They can still make shields as metal is a significant component.</p>

        <p>The secrets you’ve learned from your work also allow you to make the gear you’ve made better. Any shields or armor that you make grants an additional +1 AC to its wearer- as long as they’re proficient in the armor or shield. Additionally, any weapon that you make deals an additional 2 points of damage of the same damage type- as long as its wielder is proficient in the weapon. Despite these benefits, the gear that you create is not considered to be magical.</p>
        <h2>10th Level: Journeyman</h2>
        <p>Your travels have given you a variety of new skills. You can choose two more skills to be proficient in. You’ve also become somewhat renowned with your gear- allowing you to easily find a place to work in any town.</p>
        <p>Your travels also grant you an additional Fighting Style feat of your choice.</p>
        <h2>14th Level: Forged by the Flame</h2>
        <p>Your body has adapted to the harsh environment that you work in. You become resistant to fire damage. Additionally, your body’s become toughened from the occasional mishap. As such, you become resistant to one of the following damage types of your choice: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>

    <section class="body_p" id="subclass2">
        <h1>Heretic</h1>
        <p>Heretics are those whose core opinions and beliefs run counter to others. It’s their steadfast commitment to these beliefs that often spur persecution and brand them with the title of heretic. In battle, they draw the ire of their foes. Think about what your character's morals and ideals are. What do they believe in and how does it go against the popular consensus?</p>
        <h2>3rd Level: Beguiling Tongue</h2>
        <p>You gain the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <p>Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.</p></li>
            <li> <p>You become proficient in one of the following skills of your choice: Decpetion, Intimidation, or Persuasion.</p></li>
            <li> <p>You learn the Vicious Mockery cantrip and can cast it as a bonus action a number of times per short or long rest equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p></li>
            <li> <p>The spell save DC for any spells or feats that this subclass grants you is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3rd Level: Scathing Taunt</h2>
        <p>The heretic naturally draws the ire of others, and you can use that to your advantage. As a bonus action, you can have all creatures of your choice within 30 ft. of you that can hear you make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the creature’s attack rolls against all creatures other than you are reduced by your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) while they can see you for the next minute. Additionally, you can add your Charisma modifier to any attack rolls and damage rolls that you make against a creature that failed this saving throw for the next minute. This effect ends early if you become Incapacitated. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to this feature for 24 fours. You can use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>
        <h2>6th Level: Heretic's Cunning</h2>
        <p>You’ve learned how to manipulate the anger of your foes to your advantage in battle. A number of times per short or long rest equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you can cast a spell on the following table at its base level without expending a spell slot or material components. When you cast a spell using this feature, you can do so as a bonus action, instead of the spell’s casting time.</p>

        </table>
        <h2>6th Level: Surge of Defiance</h2>
        <p>When you roll initiative, you gain 1d6 temporary hit points for every enemy that you can see that is within 60 ft. of you, up to your proficiency bonus. For example, if you see four enemies within 60 ft. of you, but your proficiency bonus is +3, you only gain 3d6 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 minute.</p>
        <h2>10th Level: Defiant Willpower</h2>
        <p>You have advantage on saving throws against being Charmed.</p>
        <h2>10th Level: Retaliation</h2>
        <p>In the heat of battle, you’re a master at retaliating against your foes. When a creature lands an attack roll against you while in range of one of your weapons, you can use your reaction to make an attack roll against that creature. If the attack that triggers this reaction was a critical hit, your attack roll is made with advantage.</p>
        <h2>14th Level: Undying Defiance</h2>
        <p>Your willpower enables you to withstand even the deadliest of strikes. Once per long rest, when your hit points would be reduced to 0 and you are not outright killed, you can instead remain at 1 hit point.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you become proficient in Charisma saving throws.</p>

        <h1>New & Modified Battle Maneuvers</h1>
        <h2>Blinding Gouge</h2>
        <p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to strike at their eyes. You can add what you rolled on your superiority die to the damage roll. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is Blinded until the end of their next turn.</p>
        <h2>Parry</h2>
        <p>When another creature would hit you with a melee attack, and you are wielding a melee weapon, you can expend one superiority die to increase your AC by a roll of your superiority die against the triggering attack only- possibly turning the hit to a miss. If the attack still hits you, you can reduce the damage by the number you rolled on the superiority die.</p>
        <h2>Sweeping Attack</h2>
        <p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within your weapon’s reach. If the original attack roll would have hit the second creature, it is also hit with the attack. You can add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.</p>
